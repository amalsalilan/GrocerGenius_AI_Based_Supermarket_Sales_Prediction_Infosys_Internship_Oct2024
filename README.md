# GrocerGenius: AI-Based Supermarket Sales Prediction

## Objective
I built an AI model to predict supermarket sales based on historical data and developed an intuitive user interface for interaction.

---

## Dataset
- **Supermarket Sales Dataset**: The dataset contains data about supermarket sales transactions, including numerical and categorical features that were crucial for prediction.

---

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection and Exploration**
   - Defined the prediction task and understood the dataset features.
   - Loaded and explored the dataset to gain insights into the data.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed and visualized feature distributions and relationships between them.
   - Identified patterns and trends that could influence the sales predictions.
   
3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and normalized numerical features to prepare the data for model training.
   
4. **Model Building**
   - Built machine learning models using cross-validation.
   - Optimized hyperparameters and trained the model for better accuracy.
   
5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated models using performance metrics and selected the best-performing model.
   
6. **Deployment**
   - Deployed the best model using a web framework and created an API for user interaction.
